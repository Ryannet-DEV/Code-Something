### Learn Markdown
Markdown is a markup language\
In document editors like Microsoft Office Word, Google Workspace Docs, LibreOffice Write, you format text but Markdown isn't like that
Markdown has a syntax that is typed to format text and it is like HTML but easier\
So let's start!
#### Writing text
In Markdown, you write text like how you usually write text in plain text files\
The syntax in Markdown is symbols so if you put the syntax in a text, your text will be formatted
##### Line breaks
I mentioned that in Markdown, you write text like how you usually write text in plain text files but if you press Enter for a lne break, there may not be a line break so yo have to put a backslash (`\`) then go to the new line but pressing Enter two times will create an empty line between two lines
#### Styling text
##### Bold
To make text bold in Markdown, you wrap the block of text in double asterisks (`*`) or double underscores (`_`)
##### Italic
To make text italic in Markdown, you wrap the block of text in single asterisks (`*`) or single underscore (`_`)

If you want to insert asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`) without styling the text, you can put a backslash (`\`) before it
#### Headings
You can put headings in Markdown by putting a hashtag (`#`) and space before writing anything\
One hashtag means level one heading\
Number of hashtags (`#`) = Level of headings\
You cannot create a heading with a higher level than 6
#### Strikethrough
You can strike a block of text by wrapping it with two tildes (`~`)
#### Lists
##### Unordered
You can create unordered lists by putting an asterisk (`*`) and a space before writing anything
##### Ordered
You can create ordered lists by putting a number series then a period (`.`) or a close parenthesis (`)`) then a space before writing anything
##### Checklists
#### Blockquote
You can create blockquotes by adding `> ` before writing anything
#### Code
##### In between text
You can write code in between text by wrapping the code in backticks (`)
##### Single line
You can write code in a single line by leaving four spaces before writing the code
##### Multiple lines
You can write multiple lines of code by wrapping the code in triple backticks (`)
#### Table
You can create tables like this:
```
|Table header|Table header 2|
|:------------:|:------------:|
|Content line 1|Content line 1|
|Content line 2|Content line 2|
```
The vertical bar is used to indicate vertical lines of a table\
The `:------------:` divides the table
#### Link
##### With names
You can create links with names like this `[link name](https://www.link.com)`\
Any text inside the square brackets will be shown in blue underline and if anyone clicks on it, they will be redirected to the link inside the parenthesis\
Remember to not leave spaces ib between `]` and `(`
##### Without names
You can create links without names\
In text messaging apps, you just type the link and when someone clicks it, they get redirected to it but Markdown isn't like that
To create links, use this:
`<https://www.link.com>`
Any text inside the signs will be the link
#### Images
You can create images like this:
`![alternative text if by chance the image does not come](https://www.image-url.com)`
You have to put an exclamatory mark (`!`) first before typing anything\
Any text inside the square brackets will be shown if by chance the image does not come\
The image of the image url in parenthesis will be shown\
Remember to not leave spaces between `]` and `(`
