## Programming
### Learn Python
Python is a significant and easy programming language
#### Printing text
To print text in Python, use the `print()` keyword like this:\
```Python
print(7)
print("Hello World!")
```
Custom text should be surrounded in double quotes (`"`)
#### Declaring variables
To declare a variable in Python, use this:
```Python
name = "Ryannet"
```
You can replace `name` with whatever name you want but don't use keywords like `print`\
You can also see the [Python keywords](Python-keywords.md) reference\
Custom text as a value for names should be surrounded with double quotes

To create functions, use the `def` keyword like this:\
```Python
def name(arg1, arg2):
    print(arg1)
```
You can define the function to do whatever you want\
If you don't want to define it, use the `pass` keyword
#### Making conditions

```Python
if statement:
    action
```
Replace `statement` with a statement and `action` with an action to do

You can also make the condition to do something else with the `else` keyword like this:\
```Python
if statement:
    action
else:
    another action
```
##### `elif` keyword
